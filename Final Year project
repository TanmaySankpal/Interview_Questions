The types of questions that may be asked during a practical exam for your project will depend on the specific requirements and scope of your project. 
However, here are some sample questions that may be helpful:

1)Can you explain the architecture of your project and how it meets the requirements specified in the project proposal?

2)Can you walk me through the functionality of your project, including any features you implemented beyond the original requirements?

3)Can you explain how you approached testing your project, including any tools or frameworks you used, and how you ensured that your project is robust and error-free?

4)Can you demonstrate how your project integrates with any external systems or APIs, and how you ensured the security and reliability of those connections?

5)Can you explain how you managed your project, including any version control, documentation, and collaboration tools you used, 
and how you ensured that your project was completed on time and within budget?

It's important to remember that the purpose of a practical exam is to assess your understanding of the project and your ability to apply the skills and knowledge you have gained throughout your studies. 
Be prepared to answer questions in detail, and demonstrate your project's functionality and reliability.
